I started following [Devon Govett](https://twitter.com/devongovett) on Twitter well before 2.0. I was looking at
alternatives to webpack that would allow me to set up sample projects in seconds, not days (sorry webpack üòì).

**Note:** For those of you that don't know, he's the creator of [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) and a slew of other
things that you likely use everyday in the JS community.

So, I'm trolling Twitter one day (lurker status), and I see him tweet about something called "React Aria." I had an initial
look and thought, "Damn, this helps to solve so many problems we had previously solved in our design system. How can
we potentially look at integrating this into ours??"

Fast forward ~2 years. I still haven't looked at the library üò¨. I had just been promoted (üï∑Ô∏èüë®), then added a second
team to my responsbilities, and, you know, life things. Well here we are now. Let's give it the good ole college try.

## Accessibility Matters

Let me repeat, accessibility matters! I want everyone to be able to use the web. Nothing should stop someone from using
one of the greatest resources known to humankind.

In order to keep true to that statement, as developers/engineers we need to do our best to ensure everyone can access
the things on which we're working.

If you can't get behind the alturistic reasoning (sans benefits), then let's think about it this way. The more people
you have using your site, the more potential customers you have.

Just because someone may have a bit more trouble using the web (browers, phone, etc.) doesn't mean they don't want to
purchase a product (i.e. give you money).

There are many groups of people looking to improve accessbility on the web. Have a look at the content below if you
want to learn more.

1. [W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/)
    * Responsible for publishing standards like [WCAG](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/)
2. [Accessible Rich Internet Application (ARIA) Authoring Practices Guide (APG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/)
3. [UK Public Sector Accessibilty Requirements](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/accessibility-requirements-for-public-sector-websites-and-apps)
    * Spoiler, based on the WCAG standards
