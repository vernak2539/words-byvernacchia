I previously [talked about](../02/my-first-chrome-extension.mdx) my experience building my first Chrome Extension,
_Google Docs Zoom Default_.

Since then, I've been hard at work enabling the functionality for more Google Workspace Applications. Thus, I'm
introducing _[Google Workspace Zoom Default][webstore]_ (hopefully the Web Store listing updates prior to me publishing
this).

This is a pretty big release as it enables the same "default zoom" functionality in Google Sheets. This means that this
Chrome Extension supports "default zoom" functionality in:

- Google Docs
- Google Sheets

Have a look at the functionality below!

    title="YouTube video player"
    frameborder="0"
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
    allowfullscreen
  ></iframe>
</div>

## The Future

It took a bit of time to implement this functionality, but I can promise you it was well worth it. I took the time to:

- Set the base for other applications, such as Google Slides
- Set a strategy for docs where users have "view only" permissions
- Updated the extension's popup UI

Once again, [Plasmo](https://www.plasmo.com/) made it super easy to do these things.

You can see all the code on [Github][github] for the sake of transparency.
