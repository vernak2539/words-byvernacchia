As I stated in [my original post](../01/a-new-blog-why.md), I want to evaluate new frontend "languages" and frameworks.

I plan to look at the following "flavours of the month":

1.  React
2.  [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/)
3.  [SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/)
4.  [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)
5.  [qwik](https://qwik.builder.io/)
6.  [htmx](https://htmx.org/)
7.  [Lit](https://lit.dev/)
8.  [Astro](https://astro.build/)

In addition to these, I want to look at some of the frameworks that are provide for them:

1.  React
    -   [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
    -   [Remix](https://remix.run/)
2.  [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/)
3.  [SolidStart] (https://start.solidjs.com/)
    -   May wait until this one is out of beta, or may not ü§∑

I don't want to willy-nilly investigate these things, so let me define some requirements. I want to build a Pok√©dex using
the https://pokeapi.co/ API. In addition to viewing, I want to create a page where people can submit and create their
own Pok√©mon. Overall, this will include:

-   Interactions with APIs
-   Form submissions
-   Page transitions
-   Hopefully, cool other things

I'll update you as I go!
