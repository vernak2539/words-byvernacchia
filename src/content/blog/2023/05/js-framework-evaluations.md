As I stated in [my original post](../01/a-new-blog-why.md), I want to evaluate the frontend frameworks that have been
created "recently."

I plan to delve into:

1.  React
2.  [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/)
3.  [SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/)
4.  [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)
5.  [Qwik](https://qwik.builder.io/)
6.  [htmx](https://htmx.org/)
7.  [Lit](https://lit.dev/)
8.  [Astro](https://astro.build/)
    -   _kind already started haha_

In addition, I'm also planning to explore "higher-level frameworks" that supplement these, such as:

1.  React
    -   [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
    -   [Remix](https://remix.run/)
2.  [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/)
3.  [SolidStart] (https://start.solidjs.com/) _(May wait until this one is out of beta, or may not ü§∑)_

Alright, so I'm not about to dive into this without a game plan. I've got a project in mind to make this exploration a
bit more fun. Let's build a Pok√©dex, using the [Pok√©API](https://pokeapi.co/! You'll be able to check out different
Pok√©mon and even whip up your own. This will allow me to:

-   Play around with APIs
-   Handle form submissions
-   Understand pages transitions
-   And, who knows, maybe throw in a few more bells and whistles along the way!

I'll update you as I go!
