ðŸš¨ **For this post, I am assuming we're building a static site** ðŸš¨

I've finally gotten familiar with Astro. So I thought.

I wanted my posts to be a bit more organised, so I switched from no organisation / "the wild west" to organising my posts
by year and month. As of now, my Content Collection's directory structure looks like below.

```
src/content/
â””â”€â”€ blog
    â””â”€â”€ 2023
        â”œâ”€â”€ 01
        â”‚   â””â”€â”€ a-new-blog-why.md
        â”œâ”€â”€ 02
        â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 1-astro-thus-far.md
        â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ adding-comments-to-this-thing.md
        â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ how-do-search-this-thing.md
        â”‚   â””â”€â”€ my-first-chrome-extension.md
        â”œâ”€â”€ 03
        â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 1-react-aria-exploration.md
        â”‚   â””â”€â”€ introducing-google-workspace-zoom-default.md
        â”œâ”€â”€ 04
        â”‚   â””â”€â”€ simulating-js-events.mdx
        â””â”€â”€ 05
            â””â”€â”€ astro-content-collection-month-and-year-pages.md
```

I really liked the new version, but I quickly noticed something wasn't quite right.

## The Problem

When I navigated to https://words.byvernacchia.com/2023 or https://words.byvernacchia.com/2023/02 I would get a big ole
"404 Not Found." Lovely.

I thought the "magic" of Astro would automatically create these pages for me. I was sorely mistaken ðŸ˜”

After scouring their docs and posting [a question on the Astro Discord](https://discord.com/channels/830184174198718474/1097931916025544845/1097931916025544845),
I realised there wasn't much help out there. So, I got down to it.

## The Solution

Creating pages that display "Posts by Year" and "Posts by Month of the Year" both rely on the same underlying Astro APIs,
[Dynamic Routes](https://docs.astro.build/en/core-concepts/routing/#dynamic-routes) and
[`getStaticPaths()`](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/api-reference/#getstaticpaths).

Let's see how we can use these together to fix our problem.

### Posts by Year

While we can use this strategy for any Content Collection, I will be using "`blog`" as per my example above.

Let's start by creating a page at `src/pages/blog/[year]/index.astro`. This is our "Dynamic Route" that will generate
pages for every year. We can then use these pages to display the posts for that year. You can see `[year]` directory,
which we'll use later.

Next, we add our `getStaticPaths()` function to the page we just created.

```astro
---
import path from "path";
import fs from "fs";

const getDirsInDir = (dir: string) => {
    return fs
        .readdirSync(dir, { withFileTypes: true })
        .filter((item) => item.isDirectory())
        .map((item) => item.name);
};

export async function getStaticPaths() {
    const collectionDir = path.resolve(process.cwd(), "./src/content/blog/");
    const dirsInDir = getDirsInDir(collectionDir);

    return dirsInDir.map((yearDir) => {
        return {
            params: { year: yearDir },
        };
    });
}
---
```

What's going on here? Glad you asked. We:

1. Define the absolute path to the base directory of the Content Collection
2. Create an array containing all top-level directories in the Content Collection
3. Return an array of objects that Astro expects for it to build static paths ([docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/api-reference/#params))

After doing this, when running `astro build` the output will show something like this:

```
â–¶ src/pages/blog/[year]/index.astro
  â””â”€ /blog/2023/index.html (+7ms)
```

If I were to add a `2024` folder, I would generate a `/blog/2024/index.html` page.

One more thing to do. Let's display the posts for that year on the page. To do this, we can use Astro's
[`getCollection`](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/api-reference/#getcollection) (outside of `getStaticPaths()`).

```astro
---
import { getCollection } from "astro:content";

// ... prior getStaticPaths() definition

const posts = await getCollection("blog", ({ data }) => {
    const { year } = Astro.params; // dynamic route (from the "[year]" directory)

    return data.pubDate.getFullYear().toString() === year;
});
---
```

In this example, the filtering of posts by year uses the post's frontmatter data (i.e. `pubDate`), but it will likely
be different for you.

### Posts by Month of the Year

Displaying Posts by Month of the Year is basically the same, but with some extra steps.

Let's start by creating a page at `src/pages/blog/[year]/[month]/index.astro`. This time, instead of just `[year]` we've
added `[month]`. We'll use both of these "dynamic routes" later.

Just like before, we not add our `getStaticPaths()` function to the page we just created.

```astro
---
import path from "path";
import fs from "fs";

const getDirsInDir = (dir: string) => {
    return fs
        .readdirSync(dir, { withFileTypes: true })
        .filter((item) => item.isDirectory())
        .map((item) => item.name);
};

export async function getStaticPaths() {
    const collectionDir = path.resolve(process.cwd(), "./src/content/blog/");
    const yearsInDir = getDirsInDir(collectionDir);

    const paths = yearsInDir.flatMap((yearDiretory) => {
        const yearDir = path.resolve(
            process.cwd(),
            "./src/content/blog/",
            yearDiretory
        );
        const monthsInYearDir = getDirsInDir(yearDir);

        const fullPaths = monthsInYearDir.map((monthDirectory) => {
            return {
                params: { year: yearDiretory, month: monthDirectory },
            };
        });

        return fullPaths;
    });

    return paths;
}
---
```

This looks really familiar to the function that we created to list our posts for each year. But, it's a bit different, so
let's walk through what is going on.

1. Define the absolute path to the base directory of the Content Collection
2. Create an array containing all top-level directories in the Content Collection (i.e. years)
3. Iterate via `flatMap` (to combine return values) through each "year" directory
4. For each "year" directory, we:
    1. Create the absolute path to the directory
    2. Find all the top-level directories in the directory (i.e. months)
    3. Create and return objects that Astro expects for it to build static paths ([docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/api-reference/#params)) using year and month
5. Return the array of objects

After doing this, when running `astro build` the output will show something like this:

```
â–¶ src/pages/blog/[year]/[month]/index.astro
  â”œâ”€ /blog/2023/01/index.html (+3ms)
  â”œâ”€ /blog/2023/02/index.html (+6ms)
  â”œâ”€ /blog/2023/03/index.html (+9ms)
  â”œâ”€ /blog/2023/04/index.html (+12ms)
  â””â”€ /blog/2023/05/index.html (+15ms)
```

If I were to add some posts in January 2024, Astro would then generate a `/blog/2024/01/index.html` page.

Last, but not least, let's display the posts for said year and month on the page.

```astro
---
import { getCollection } from "astro:content";

// ... prior getStaticPaths() definition

const posts = await getCollection("blog", ({ data }) => {
    const { year, month } = Astro.params;
    const isYear = data.pubDate.getFullYear().toString() === year;
    const isMonth = data.pubDate.getMonth() === parseInt(month, 10) - 1;

    return isMonth && isYear;
});
---
```

(Again, using the post's frontmatter data (i.e. `pubDate`) for filtering)

ðŸ’¡Remember, `Date.prototype.getMonth()` is zero-based (where zero indicates the first month of the year).

And there we have it, pages that display posts by year and month of the year!

Maybe I do have the hang of Astro!

You can use my blog as an example for the full integration. Or, post a comment below, and we can have a discusion!
