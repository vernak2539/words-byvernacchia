I've been working on my _[Google Workspace Zoom Default][webstore]_ Chrome Extension to implement a
[requested feature][feature-request] where users can use custom zoom values in addition to the predefined zoom values
that Google provides in their application's zoom dropdown.

I thought to myself, "I already simulate events. This should be easy." So, I started to try and figure it out. If you
want to skip ahead, feel free to go to the ["Implementing with `chrome.debugger`"](#implemnting) section.
