Hmm... so this site doesn't have comments. Let's fix that.

Since I'm pretty lazy, let's go for the easiest thing...

This blog will likely be read by devs, so why not give [utterances][utter] a try?!?

[utterances][utter] is:

> A lightweight comments widget built on GitHub issues. Use GitHub issues for blog comments, wiki pages and more!

Sounds perfect... Let's add it to the site (i.e. hopefully you'll see something at the bottom of the page).

## Update

And there we have it. It seems to be added to the page.

It was relatively simple as I used some info from [this blog post](https://www.jamesperkins.dev/post/supercharge-your-astro-blog). Ended up
using standard JS instead of Svelte.

~Hopefully it works when it's deployed!~ IT WORKED! I love the lazy solution!
