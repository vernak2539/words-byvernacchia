<NewExtensionNameBanner />

Following my blog post where I explore [_"Simulating" JS Events_](../04/simulating-js-events.mdx), I finally did
the work to implement custom zoom levels in my Chrome Extension, [_Google Workspace Zoom Default_][webstore].

But, I actually didn't implement the functionality it in my existing extension. Why? You may ask.

Well, in order to use the [`chrome.debugger` API](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/debugger/), I
have to request elevated permissions from the person using my extension. If I were to do this in my existing extension,
all users would have to explicitly accept the new permissions I've requested.

This gives users the following options:

1. Open the extension and re-enable it, accepting new permissions
2. Open the extension and actively choose _not_ to re-enable it due to new permissions
3. Not notice the extension has stopped working and it stays disabled

In my opinion, #2 and #3 are the most likely situation. Obviously, these are the worst possible outcomes for the people using
my extension, and I want to enable as many people as possible to use the functionality I provide.

Based on this, I introduce the [_Google Workspace Zoom Default - Extended_][webstore-extended] extension. This extension
includes all the functionality of the regular extension **AND** allows for custom zoom values.

I've updated my YouTube video to demostrate the new functionality.

<div class="youtubeWrapper">
    <iframe
        width="560"
        height="315"
        src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WYmmMaQXE7Y?start=17.5"
        title="YouTube video player"
        frameborder="0"
        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
        allowfullscreen
    ></iframe>
</div>

Hope this helps someone!
