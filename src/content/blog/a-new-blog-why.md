I've been working at [Deliveroo](https://deliveroo.co.uk/) for quite some time, just over 4 years in fact! (That's forever in tech years)

When I was hired, my background was pretty spcific to FE-esque (frontend) things.

1. Know my way around a browser ‚úÖ
2. Have set up and debugged too many webpack configs ‚úÖ
3. Investigated various styles of testing (still like TDD for unit tests. fight me) ‚úÖ
4. Kept up with Node.js, React, and other tech ‚úÖ
5. Can debate endlessly about _shit_... ‚úÖ
6. Knew Backbone.js, Angular.js, and React + could pick up most FE stacks ‚úÖ

Unfortunately, I moved to a different team after about 6-8 months and they didn't need many of these skills. Instead, they needed me to get up to speed with BE technologies. So, I did. It's what my team needed.

Over the years (yes, years) the teams I was/am responsible for improved vastly. Like, so amazing. Maybe that's another blog post, but I digress.

During that time, I let my FE knowledge slip. All the flame wars between Svelte, Solid, React Suspense (still a thing like it was a while ago?!?!), XState, Remix, etc. = üçø. I didn't have time to have a look. Hot takes were my sources of information.

I am finally at a point where I can come back and investigate new FE tech! I've been lucky enough to schedule a half day every week to do so. My manager even supports it. Hell, it was his idea.

I'm really excited to get back into the FE space, allowing myself to evaluate different options and potentially bring some back to Deliveroo.

Anyway, I'll be blogging about my experiences on this site, which I built with Astro (awww yeahhhh, new and shiny).
