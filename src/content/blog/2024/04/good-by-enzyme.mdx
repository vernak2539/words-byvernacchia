I've showed my age in the [previous post](./snapshot-testing-sucks.md), so I won't do it again. But, for the
purposes of this post, I will say that I've been a professional in the industry prior to [Enzyme](https://enzymejs.github.io/enzyme/),
during its height, and after it (i.e. now).

This leads me to say, using my _expert_ opinion, "Goodbye Enzyme, and good riddance. You will not be missed."

That may seem harsh, but I firmly believe it. I've recently removed Enzyme from multiple, highly used codebases at my work
and have see the horrors caused by Enzyme. I'll cover some of these in this article, comparing it to [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/).

## Enzyme? React Testing Library (RTL)? What are they?

They are both testing frameworks aiming to make it easier to test React components. They both have their own philosophies
and ways of doing things.

### Enzyme

> Enzyme is a JavaScript Testing utility for React that makes it easier to test your React Components' output.
> You can also manipulate, traverse, and in some ways simulate runtime given the output.

## RTL

> You want to write maintainable tests that give you high confidence that your components are working for your users.
> As a part of this goal, you want your tests to avoid including implementation details so refactors of your components
> (changes to implementation but not functionality) don't break your tests and slow you and your team down.

These differing philosophies are the main reason why I prefer RTL over Enzyme. Enzyme is more focused on the "output" of
a component. Additionally, they talk about traversing, manipulating, and simulating the output, which does not align
with hoe actual users would be interacting with it.

On the other hand, RTL is more focused on the "functionality" of a component. It is more concerned with how a user would
interact with the component, and how the component would respond to that interaction. ❤️
