# Google Workspace Default Zoom is Everywhere!

When I started creating my browser extension, I focused on Google Chrome.

I did this because we use Google Chrome as our default browser at work, and work is the place I primarily use
the Google Workspace suite. Makes sense, huh?!?

**But**, obviously there are other browsers out there. I want to ensure my extension can be useful to as many
people as possible. So, I started trying to figure out how to port my extension to other browsers.

I'm glad to announce, I've finally released the extension for both Firefox and Edge! ðŸŽ‰

## New Browsers!!

### Firefox

I am only able to offer the base extension for Firefox. This means Firefox users can only use predefined zoom values.
I talk more about why this is in the [technical details section](#the-technical-deets-details).

If you use Firefox, you can install the extension via the [Firefox ðŸ¦Š Add-ons website](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/google-workspace-zoom-default/).

Now those of you who don't want to ditch uBlock Origin can have this functionality! ðŸ˜œ

### Edge

Edge uses Chromium under the hood, so all the features offered in both extension versions worked out of the box!

If you use Edge, you can install the extension from the Microsoft Edge Add-ons website:

1. [Google Workspace Default Zoom](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/google-workspace-zoom-def/hnilnnalkgihkfnegpcbcgpgailgjbnn)
2. [Google Workspace Default Zoom - Extended](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/google-workspace-zoom-def/fhjmigdmbgbiodkejhmahfnaebdgnmjb)
   - In exchange for allowing elevated permissions, this extension provides ability to set custom zoom levels (as opposed to only predefined values)

## The Technical Deets (Details)

I know a lot of you come here for the technical details of things, so I won't disappoint and get started!

As I've pointed out before, I use [Plasmo](https://www.plasmo.com/) to build my extension. From their website:

> Plasmo helps you build, test, and deploy powerful, cutting-edge products on top of the web browser.

And oh boy, it not disppoint! I was able to get the extension ported to Firefox and Edge relatively quickly. I think the
thing that took me the longest time was figuring out how to sign up to become a Microsoft Edge Add-on developer. ðŸ˜… It
also took me quite a while to configure the Edge store listings, even though I'd already documented them!

## Firefox

Okay, so Firefox was an interesting one. I almost gave up a few times, but I figured it out in the end!

### Impossible to debug in dev mode

Using Plasmo in dev mode was impossible. Firefox seemed to block the WebSocket connection (I think), which forced the
extension to reload itself continuously. This made debugging impossible as the extension was never able to be used (it
disappeared and reappeared too quickly). The only way to stop it was to disable the extension via the debugging page.

I ended up just running `plasmo build` after every change and reloading the extension. It was a bit of a pain, but it
worked. First hurdle done!

### No Extended version ðŸ˜ž

After I got it working, I tried to use custom zoom values. It didn't work.

After more and more digging, I found an [MDN page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/manifest.json/permissions)
confirming the `debugger` permission is unavailable in Firefox. It says it's available in Manifest V2 and V3, but when
you actually go the[ Browser Compatibility](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/manifest.json/permissions#browser_compatibility)
section, you can see it's not available in Firefox. ðŸ˜­

So, I unfortunately can't ship the Extended version of the extension to Firefox. I'm sorry Firefox users! ðŸ˜ž I'll keep
an eye out for any changes in the future! Promise!

### Manifest V2 vs V3

Amazing, Firefox is transitionin gto Manifest V3, which is the same version used by Chrome (and shit because uBlock Origin
will be disabled due to this). Easy, right?!? Please...I struggled from the start.

I tried to use Manifest V3 from the start. All the docs said you had to define your Add-on's ID in the manifest. So, I went
looking for my Add-on's ID. But, don't you have to publish it first before you get an ID? That's how the Chrome Webstore
works...

After banging my head all over the place, it turns out you **don't have to publish the Add-on to get an Add-on ID.** You
just, wait for it, create it yourself. Their docs don't explain this in a straightforward way.

So, I generated a UUID and added it to my manifest in the right form (`{UUID}`). Cool, Storage API is working
